This repo document experiments on LLM inference to bugs as deviant behavior: i) programmer beliefs; ii) how programmer beliefs inform correctness rules 

In the table below, we provide full inferred beliefs of prf in the first three rows. From the fourth row onwards, we sample one MUST belief and one MAY belief. To check out full
inference results (all inferred beliefs), please look at [LLM results folder](https://github.com/sallywang147/DeviantBugs/tree/main/LLMResults)


A simple double free bug example from bugs as deviant behavior: 

```
1 if (copy_to_user (...))
2    cmd_free(NULL, c) ;
3 if (buff != NULL) kfree(buff) ;
4    return(-EFAULT) ;
 )
5 if (io¢ommand.Direction == XFER_READ)
6 if (copy_to_user (...))
7   cmd_free(NULL, c) ;
8   kfree (buff) ;
)
9 cmd_free(NULL, c) ;
10 if (buff != NULL) kfree(buff); 
```

Below is an analysis of the given code with inferred **MUST beliefs** and **MAY beliefs** for each line:

### Summary Table:

| Line | MUST Beliefs                                                                                           | MAY Beliefs                                                                                     |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | `copy_to_user` result must be checked.                                                                 | `copy_to_user` may indicate safe data transfer or an error.                                     |
| 2    | `cmd_free(NULL, c)` is valid and necessary to clean resources.                                         | `cmd_free` may be error handling for `copy_to_user`.                                            |
| 3    | `buff` may be `NULL`, so a check is required before `kfree`.                                           | `buff` may point to dynamic memory requiring explicit freeing.                                  |
| 4    | Returning `-EFAULT` is appropriate for the error condition.                                            | `-EFAULT` may sufficiently describe the fault to the caller.                                   |
| 5    | `io¢ommand.Direction` determines logic execution.                                                      | `XFER_READ` may imply a specific read operation requiring special handling.                     |
| 6    | Same as Line 1.                                                                                        | Same as Line 1.                                                                                 |
| 7    | Same as Line 2.                                                                                        | Same as Line 2.                                                                                 |
| 8    | `buff` is non-`NULL`, and `kfree(buff)` is necessary to prevent leaks.                                  | Context may guarantee `buff` is valid.                                                         |
| 9    | Same as Line 2 and Line 7.                                                                             | Repeated `cmd_free` calls may be thorough cleanup or redundant.                                 |
| 10   | Same as Line 3.                                                                                        | Same as Line 3.                                                                                 |

This analysis captures the programmer's beliefs as directly implied (MUST) or suggested (MAY) by the code.

| Linux Kernel 5.15        |   [prf patch](https://github.com/sallywang147/DeviantBugs/blob/main/bugs/linux/bug1_fullpatch.patch)  | 1. **Buffer Memory Management**: - The programmer must believe that the buffer allocated with `vzalloc` must be freed using `vfree` when not needed anymore. This is evident from the consistent cleanup code paths ensuring buffers are freed. 2. **Locking Protocol**: - The programmer must believe that the `pgo_lock` needs to be held during certain operations (e.g., calculating `prf_buffer_size`, calling `prf_serialize`). This explicit requirement is mentioned in the comments.3. **Avoid Memory Overflow**: - The programmer must believe in checking against potential overflow of `p->size` compared to `buf_size`. Hence, they introduced a condition to catch this case and return `-EAGAIN`.4. **Proper Buffer Allocation**: - The size of a buffer allocation is adjusted using `PAGE_ALIGN`, which implies a belief that allocated memory must be aligned to page boundaries for efficient memory management.5. **Error Handling**: - They must believe in robust error handling, as demonstrated by checks against conditions like `!data` and using `goto` for cleanup processes on errors.|  1. **Buffer Size Recalculation**:- The programmer may believe that recalculating the buffer size (`prf_buffer_size`) after initially setting it is necessary to account for some dynamic condition not made explicit in the code comments.2. **Repeated Allocation Strategy**: - The use of a `do-while` loop to retry allocation on `-EAGAIN` may indicate a belief that `prf_serialize` might require adjusting the buffer dynamically, even though this flow might not be common. 3. **Usage of `PAGE_ALIGN`**: - They may believe that aligning buffer sizes this way could optimize certain memory operations related to pages, although it might not be strictly necessary for correctness. 4. **Explicit Type Change (`unsigned long` to `size_t`)**:- The change in type for `size` from `unsigned long` to `size_t` may indicate a belief about better portability or correctness for size-related operations, but this is dependent on context outside the provided patch.|
|  Linux Kernel 5.15           |   [prf bug](https://github.com/sallywang147/DeviantBugs/blob/main/LLMResults/bug1.txt)   | 1. **Successful Memory Allocation**: - The code uses `kzalloc` to allocate memory for `struct prf_private_data`. The programmer must believe that these allocations will succeed, as the allocation result is assigned to `data` and the program proceeds to use this memory. There is a check `if (!data) { err = -ENOMEM; goto out; }`, indicating they must handle failures, but initially, they proceed assuming success.2. **Non-NULL Buffer**:  - The `prf_serialize` function assigns the result of `vzalloc(p->size)` to `p->buffer` and checks `if (!p->buffer) { err = -ENOMEM; }`. The later usage in the code assumes that `p->buffer` is non-NULL unless an error (`ENOMEM`) is explicitly handle 3. **Correct Memory Size Calculation**:  - `prf_buffer_size()` returns the size of `struct llvm_prf_header`, which is used to allocate memory. The programmer must believe that this size calculation is correct and represents the necessary and sufficient amount of memory needed for `p->buffer`.4. **Protection Against Concurrency**: - The use of locks or serialization (`prf_unlock(flags);`) suggests that the programmer must believe some form of synchronization or protection is necessary when accessing shared resources or performing certain operations in `prf_open`.| 1. **Dependencies on External Includes**:- The inclusion of headers like `<linux/slab.h>`, `<linux/vmalloc.h>`, and `"pgo.h"` suggests that the programmer may believe functionalities declared there are necessary for their implementation. The dependency on external code can sometimes be more than what's strictly needed, indicating a MAY belief regarding the extent of use.2. **Error Propagation**:- The function `prf_serialize` sets `err = -ENOMEM` following a failed memory allocation and returns this error indirectly through `prf_open` return code. The handling of this specific error type indicates the programmer may believe managing this particular error code is necessary, though other error checks might not be visible in this snippet 3. **Correctness of Global Resources**:- The snippet references `struct dentry *directory;` defined globally. Although not directly used in the provided snippet, the presence of this global variable may suggest a belief in its necessity for the module's overall functionality, which may not be entirely evident from the snippet itself without further context.4. **Use of Flags in `prf_open`**:- The usage of flags in `prf_open` with `prf_unlock(flags);` suggests that these flags might control specific behaviors or states in the function. The programmer may believe that setting and using these flags correctly is crucial for the function's correct operation, though the snippet does not provide details on how they are initialized or used elsewhere.   |
|  Linux Kernel 5.15     |  [prf bug fix](https://github.com/sallywang147/DeviantBugs/blob/main/fixes/linux/bug1_fix.c)   | 1. **Holding `pgo_lock`:** - The comment explicitly states that the caller *must* hold `pgo_lock` when calling `prf_buffer_size()` and `prf_serialize()`, indicating a strong belief that concurrent access to these routines could lead to data races or corruption.2. **`prf_buffer_size()` must match required buffer constraints:**- There's an explicit check in the `prf_serialize` function that ensures `p->size` (determined by `prf_buffer_size()`) does not exceed `buf_size`. This suggests a belief that buffer sizes must be appropriately calculated and allocated to prevent overflow.3. **Buffer allocation:**- The programmer uses `vzalloc` conditional on previous allocation being freed (`vfree`). This guarantees that the data buffer is initialized with zeros.4. **Handling `ENOMEM` errors and retries on `-EAGAIN`:**- Upon encountering an error, especially `-ENOMEM`, the function will `goto` cleanup, emphasizing that memory allocation failures are critical and should be handled immediately.5. **Memory cleanup:**- In case of errors, the memory for both `data->buffer` and `data` itself is freed. This demonstrates a belief in preventing memory leaks.6. **Data serialization assurance:**- Post allocation, serialization (`prf_serialize`) is repeatedly attempted until success or a non-retryable error, highlighting the importance of ensuring correct data formatting before proceeding.|  1. **Data and buffer association:**- `data->buffer` should point to a `vzalloc()`'d area, but this might also imply a belief that the order of allocations and frees needs to be maintained, though it may coincide with typical allocation patterns.2. **Use of `kzalloc`:**- The function uses `kzalloc` to zero-initialize `data`, suggesting a belief that the structure should start off with predefined values, potentially to prevent undefined behavior from garbage values.3. **Buffer size recalculation:** - The need for recalculating buffer size with `PAGE_ALIGN` suggests a concern for minimizing memory fragmentation or aligning to system page size, but this might also be incidental based on memory management patterns generally encouraged in kernel development.4. **`prf_lock()` and retry pattern:**- The lock and retry pattern suggests a belief that serialization may sporadically fail due to timing or content-related issues, but this behavior could just be a precaution rather than based on observed issues.|
|  Linux Kernel 5.15     | [btrfs patch](https://github.com/sallywang147/DeviantBugs/blob/main/bugs/linux/bug2_fullpatch.patch) | 1. **Data Relocation Process Identification**:- The programmer must believe that distinguishing whether a root is a data relocation root is critical, hence the addition of `btrfs_is_data_reloc_root` function.- The use of a spinlock (`relocation_bg_lock`) for accessing and modifying `data_reloc_bg` indicates a belief that accessing this resource needs to be synchronized. | 1. **Performance Optimization** - The programmer may believe that checking if a block group allocation is for data relocation can optimize performance or prevent issues specific to relocation processes.|
|  Linux Kernel 5.15     | [btrfs bug](https://github.com/sallywang147/DeviantBugs/blob/main/bugs/linux/bug2.c) |1. **Synchronize Access to Shared Data:** - The use of spinlocks and mutex implies the MUST belief that certain data access must be synchronized to prevent race conditions.  | 1. **Specific Lock Sequence:**The sequence and type of locks initiated may suggest designed patterns for accessing various structures,|
|  Linux Kernel 5.15     | [btrfs bug fix](https://github.com/sallywang147/DeviantBugs/blob/main/fixes/linux/bug2_fix.c) | The function `btrfs_alloc_path()` suggests a MUST belief that the programmer assumes it may return `NULL`, so it checks for this condition immediately (`if (!path)`).  | The sequence of `spin_lock()` initializations may suggest a MAY belief that the order might reflect some dependency or logical grouping |
|  Linux Kernel 5.15     | [new masking patch](https://github.com/sallywang147/DeviantBugs/blob/main/bugs/linux/bug3_fullpatch.patch) | The addition of a spinning mechanism in `do_idle` suggests the programmer must believe that under certain conditions, CPUs should spin instead of entering a deeper idle state| The predefined constants for spin delay, expand delay, and patience levels (e.g., `SPIN_DELAY`, `EXPAND_DELAY`, `INIT_PATIENCE`) may suggest the programmer thinks these are generally useful heuristics|
|  Linux Kernel 5.15     | [new masking bug](https://github.com/sallywang147/DeviantBugs/blob/main/bugs/linux/bug3.c) | The programmer must believe that checking for overflow is necessary after left-shifting `acnt` by `2*SCHED_CAPACITY_SHIFT`|The use of per-CPU writes might imply a belief in optimizing performance impacts due to frequent frequency tick updates.|
|  Linux Kernel 5.15     | [new masking bug fix](https://github.com/sallywang147/DeviantBugs/blob/main/fixes/linux/bug3_fix.c) | 1. **`arch_scale_freq_tick()`**: - The programmer must believe that the accessed `aperf` and `mperf` are valid for writing (`this_cpu_write()`). | The inclusion of `has_idle_threads` and `left_off` might indicate an intent to optimize idle thread handling or improve load distribution metrics|
