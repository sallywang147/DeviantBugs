To infer the sets of MUST and MAY beliefs held by the programmer regarding the given code snippets, we'll analyze the presented buggy code in the context of the patch. This involves understanding the intended logic of the programs and the assumptions the programmer likely held when implementing the functionalities.

### Code Analysis

Given the provided snippets from the patch, here is an analysis of each section:

1. **`arch_scale_freq_tick` in `smpboot.c`:**
   ```c
   void arch_scale_freq_tick(void)
   	this_cpu_write(arch_prev_aperf, aperf);
   	this_cpu_write(arch_prev_mperf, mperf);

   	if (check_shl_overflow(acnt, 2*SCHED_CAPACITY_SHIFT, &acnt))
   		goto error;
   ```

   The code involves writing some performance-related values and checking for overflow.

   **MUST Beliefs:**
   - The programmer must believe that `apitc_curr_cpu` calls correctly update CPU-specific data structures since they directly manipulate per-CPU variables.
   - The programmer must believe that checking for overflow is necessary after left-shifting `acnt` by `2*SCHED_CAPACITY_SHIFT`.

   **MAY Beliefs:**
   - The programmer may believe that avoiding a computation when overflow is possible is crucial, indicating potential past issues with integer overflow.
   - The use of per-CPU writes might imply a belief in optimizing performance impacts due to frequent frequency tick updates.

2. **`struct task_struct` in `sched.h`:**
   ```c
   struct task_struct {
   #ifdef CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK

   	int recent_used_cpu;
   	int wake_cpu;
   #endif
   	int on_rq;
   ```

   This code snippet defines the structure and some fields are conditionally included based on configuration.

   **MUST Beliefs:**
   - The programmer must believe that `recent_used_cpu`, `wake_cpu`, and `on_rq` are essential fields for task management in the kernel.
   - The programmer must believe that including `recent_used_cpu` and `wake_cpu` is only valid under specific configurations (`CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK`).

   **MAY Beliefs:**
   - The conditional inclusion of fields may suggest a belief that these fields enhance some systems' performance or functionality without being universally necessary.
   - It's implied that tasks have CPU affinity-related information that is crucial for scheduling decisions.

3. **`sched_domain_shared` and `sched_domain` in `topology.h`:**
   While most of the structure is not directly shown, it typically represents shared scheduling domains.

   **MUST Beliefs:**
   - The programmer must believe that having atomic and integer fields (`nr_busy_cpus`, `has_idle_cores`, and `nr_idle_scan`) is crucial for efficient domain-level scheduling management.

   **MAY Beliefs:**
   - The existence of `has_idle_cores` may suggest that managing idle cores is important for power efficiency.

4. **Functions in `core.c`:**
   ```c
   void do_set_cpus_allowed(struct task_struct *p, const struct cpumask *new_mask)
   {
   	__do_set_cpus_allowed(p, new_mask, 0);
   }
   
   int select_task_rq(struct task_struct *p, int cpu, int wake_flags)
   	* [ this allows ->select_task() to simply return task_cpu(p) and
   	*   not worry about this generic constraint ]
   	*/
   if (unlikely(!is_cpu_allowed(p, cpu)))
   ```

   **MUST Beliefs:**
   - The programmer must believe that calling `__do_set_cpus_allowed` ensures the task's CPU mask adheres to system constraints.
   - The programmer must believe that checking `is_cpu_allowed` is crucial for maintaining valid CPU affinity settings.

   **MAY Beliefs:**
   - The programmer may believe `select_task_rq` provides a flexibility feature intended for specific scheduling constraints.
   - The alignment of tasks with specific CPUs may hint at beliefs regarding load balancing and performance skew.

By analyzing these snippets, we understand both the explicit beliefs required by the implementation and potential implications arising from the code's structure and intent.
